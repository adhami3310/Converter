## Features

Converter supports converting from the following datatypes:
 - image/jpeg
 - image/png
 - image/webp
 - image/svg+xml (with scaling)
 - image/heif and image/heic
 - image/bmp

Into the following datatypes:
 - image/jpeg
 - image/png
 - image/webp
 - application/pdf
 - image/heif and image/heic
 - image/bmp

It also supports the following options:
 - Changing quality value of lossy compression.
 - Changing the color value of the alpha layer.
 - Changing the DPI of SVG images.
 - Scaleing and resizing the image to given resolution or ratio.

ImageMagick supports many other datatypes. I will add more and possibly even add more options. If you want me to make something of a higher priority please start an issue.
