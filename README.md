It is advised that you manually give it "All user files" (filesystem=home) through Flatseal to overcome [this Flatpak issue](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/477), so it can suggest you to save the output file in the same input directory.

## About

Converter is designed to give you a simple, quick, and easy-to-use tool to convert and manipulate your images in whatever way you like. It is built on top of the most advanced image editing libraries, ImageMagick. See [Press](PRESS.md) for content mentioning Converter from various writers, content creators, etc.

Converter supports converting the following datatypes:
 - image/jpeg (RW)
 - image/png (RW)
 - image/webp (RW)
 - image/svg+xml (R) (with scaling)
 - image/heif (RW) and image/heic (RW)
 - image/bmp (RW)
 - image/avif (RW)
 - image/jxl (RW)
 - application/pdf (W)

It also supports the following options:
 - Changing quality value of lossy compression.
 - Changing the color value of the alpha layer.
 - Changing the DPI of SVG images.
 - Scaleing and resizing the image to given resolution or ratio.

You can also drag and drop as well as paste the copied image into the app!

ImageMagick supports many other datatypes. I will add more and possibly even add more options. If you want me to make something of a higher priority please start an issue.

## Credits

Actively developed by Khaleel Al-Adhami.

This is a fork of [`Upscaler`](https://gitlab.com/TheEvilSkeleton/Upscaler) by Hari Rana (TheEvilSkeleton) to convert images instead of upscaling them. Check out their project!

This app uses a variety of libraries but the main one is [ImageMagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick), which without their generous contribution to the open source community this would be nearly impossible to make.
